# discord-bot-info-alert

Discord bot to send informative alerts. Keeping track of users' list of subscriptions, this bot can fetch data from APIs periodically or on-demand. 

The information of supported subscriptions (e.g. name, url and endpoint of API, etc.) is stored in MongoDB while miscellaneous and private details (e.g. Discord channel ID and token, time to send info, active subscriptions, etc.) is stored locally in `config.json`â€”examples shown below.
